 I have successfully configured a new department within the osTicket system specifically for SysAdmins. This department is set to an active status, indicating that it is currently operational for handling tickets.  The setup includes system defaults for Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and scheduling, optimizing response times and ticket handling efficiency.

The setup allows for detailed specification of the ticketâ€™s attributes, including priority, department assignment, and the related service level agreement (SLA). The form is designed to capture essential information from the user, ensuring a clear and concise ticket submission. Features like auto-response and alert settings are also configurable, allowing for automated communication upon ticket creation and updates.
